## Learning Markdown

### GitHub
Today we learned how to create repositories and pages within GitHub, a place to store and share code online.  Repositories are places to store files related to a single project, such as a website.  GitHub Pages are the 'live' version of the GitHub Repositories, showing the end result of the code written in the repository.

### Markdown

Mark up languages, such as HTML, style text on the web.  However, sometimes we prefer to write with mark up languages that are easier to read and write **and** that are less expressive than HTML.  Markdown is one of these languages.  Using non-alphabetic characters, coders can quickly and simply bold and italicize text, add images, add links, and create headings.
