## 102-Learning Journal

**Introduction**

Hello!  My name is Rebecca.  I am a librarian with an interest in coding.  Puzzle-solving is my specialty!  I hope to review and perfect old coding skills, deepening my knowledge of standards and the industry, and learning more coding.

### Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is the idea you can continue to improve yourself over time and are not constrained by your current limitations. With practice, persistance, acceptance of constuctive criticism, and a willingness to practice self-assessment, one can continually improve over time.  In the field of classical music performance, the general public believes if you aren't _**born** with musical talent you can **never** be a great musician_.  However, musicians know that with lots of consistant practice and assessment, anyone can become a _great_ performer and ***surpass*** those 'musical geniuses' who do not.

#### Personal Reminders
1. Practice, Practice, Practice.
2. Stuck? Do a mental reboot, instead of a shutdown.
3. To infinity and beyond!

Francois de La Rochefoucauld:

>Few people have the wisdom to prefer the criticism 
>that would do them good, to the praise that deceives them.
