### Text Editor Classifications

Text editors allow you to write text on a computer.  There are several different types of text editors, two of which are word processors and code editors.  Word processors are commonly used by people to write letters, reports, essays, articles, and other documents for human readers.  Code editors are used instead to write the text that builds a website and have features that make it easier to effectively read, write, and edit code, such as code completion, syntax highlighting, theme variety, and extensions that add other functionality.

Technically, one could write code in a word processor, but this would be exceedingly time consumming, require more care, and have none of the functionality provided by a code editor.  

**Word Processor Examples-** Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, WordPerfect, etc

**Code Editor Examples-** GitHub's Atom, Mcrosofts' VS Code, NotePad++, Nano, Vim, Emacs, Dreamweaver, etc

#### Vocabulary

**Command Line Interface (CLI)-** A text-based way for users to interact with their computer, such as moving files, updating files, changing directories, finding files, open files, and more.

**Terminal-** A Command Line Interface application that allows user to perform file explorer tasks.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)-** A pictoral-based dislay for users to interact with their computer, such as moving files, updating files, changing directories, finding files, open files, and more.

**IDE-** An IDE, short for Integrated Development Environment, is a text editor.  But it is also so much more.  It also allows you to manage your files, debug, and compile all in one place.

**VS Code-** Short for Visual Studio Code, this is a free Microsoft code editor.  As with others, it allows you to edit your code with syntax highlighting and code completion and provides lots of extensions.

**Abstraction-** The concept of hiding unnecessary information and details to make it more accessible to the user.  In orchestral music, each instrument only receives the score with their musical part on it.  Only the conductor receives the score with all the parts listed, because they are only one who needs to know everything.  The individual instruments' scores have been abstracted to make it easier to read and understand.

#### Command Line Cheat Sheet
- pwd - Print Working Directory (aka Where am I?)
- ls - List (aka What's here?)
  - -a - include hidden files
  - -l - include more information the contents
- cd - Change Directory (aka Let's move)
- file - File Type (aka What is it?)
- ~ - Home Directory
- . - Current Directory
- .. - Parent Directory
- Absolute Paths - location in relation to the root director
- Relative Paths - location in relation to where you are

##### Notes
Spaces in file names are ***INADVISABLE*** and Command Line is case sensitive.
