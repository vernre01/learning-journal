## Git

Git is a version control system.  Version control systems allow multiple developers to work on the same code and keeps a history of changes to files.  Developers can view, apply, and remove the changes using Git.  This allows developers to test out changes to their code without losing their previous work.  If the new code is broken (doesn't work), developers can revert back to a previous version of the code that did work.

Git also makes multiple backups of the repository, known as mirrored repositories, making it more specifically a distributed version control system.

### Git vs. GitHub

GitHub is an online repository.  A storage place online for coders to share code online and collaborate with others.  The "Git" of GitHub comes from their use of Git as their version contol system.
