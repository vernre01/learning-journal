## Computer Architecture and Logic

### What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
A computer is defined by its ability to accept new informtion through a person's actions (**Input**), keep this information for future use (**Storage**), manipulates the information in a task (**Processing**), and give new information back to the person using it (**Output**).  

The earliest thinking machines that filled up a room to the most complicated video game engines of today all do these four things.

### Binary &amp; Data
All data on computers takes the form of zeros and ones.  This is what is referred to as Binary.  A series of zeros and ones can be put together to express numbers.  

But what about letters, images, video, and audio?  Letters, image pixels, individual points on an audio file's sound waves, and a video's pixels and sound waves are all represented by numbers.  These numbers can then be turned into binary.  The size and amount of numbers it can take to create images and videos is why these items take up more space in storage on your computer.

### Hardware &amp; Software
Hardware is the physical items you can see that make up the computer, including the CPU and memory.  Software is not visible, but is instead the code that tells the computer perform tasks.  Binary is the most basic software, but is rarely used today.  Software languages like Python, C++, and Ruby are translated into binary before being run by the computer.

The operating system is the master program of the computer.  It is the operating system that controls other software on the computer and when it can use the hardware of the computer.
